When developing web API clients, especially for in C#. There are few popular options as far I can see: Kiota, Refit, Flurl, and RestSharp.

<!-- more -->

## Tech stack options

### Kiota

[Kiota](https://github.com/microsoft/kiota) is a code generator that creates API clients from OpenAPI descriptions. It supports multiple programming languages and aims to provide a consistent and type-safe way to interact with APIs.

Its primary purpose is to automatically generate API clients, which accelerates development but can also limit flexibility.

Pros:

- **Type Safety**: Generates strongly-typed clients, reducing runtime errors.
- **Multi-language Support**: Can generate clients for various languages.
- **Consistency**: Ensures a uniform approach to API consumption.

Cons:

- **Learning Curve**: Requires understanding of OpenAPI and the Kiota toolchain.
- **Setup**: Initial setup can be time-consuming.
- **Strict OpenAPI Definition**: The OpenAPI documentation must be precise and accurate.

### Refit

[Refit](https://github.com/reactiveui/refit) is a library for .NET that turns REST APIs into live interfaces. It uses attributes to define API endpoints and automatically generates the necessary code to call them.

Within the library, it uses source generator to generate interface implementation.

With [Refitter](https://github.com/christianhelle/refitter), C# REST API Client could be auto generated.

Pros:

- **Simplicity**: Easy to use with minimal boilerplate code.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with .NET projects.
- **Maintainability**: Changes to API endpoints are easy to manage.

Cons:

- **Limited to .NET**: Only available for .NET languages.
- **Performance**: May have overhead due to reflection.

### Flurl

[Flurl](https://github.com/tmenier/Flurl) is a modern, fluent, asynchronous, testable, and portable URL builder and HTTP client library for .NET. It simplifies making HTTP calls and handling URLs in a clean and readable way.

Pros:

- **Ease of Use**: Provides a fluent interface for building URLs and making HTTP requests.
- **Asynchronous**: Fully supports async/await for non-blocking operations.
- **Testable**: Designed with testability in mind, making it easy to mock HTTP calls.
- **Portable**: Works across different .NET platforms, including .NET Core and .NET Framework.

Cons:

- **Learning Curve**: May require some time to get familiar with its fluent syntax.
- **Dependency**: Adds an additional dependency to your project.

### RestSharp

[RestSharp](https://github.com/restsharp/RestSharp) is a popular library for building API clients in .NET. It provides a simple and flexible way to interact with RESTful services.

Pros:

- **Feature-Rich**: Supports a wide range of features like authentication, serialization, and more.
- **Community Support**: Large user base and active community.
- **Flexibility**: Can be used for simple and complex scenarios.

Cons:

- **Complexity**: Can be overkill for simple APIs.
- **Performance**: May have performance overhead in some cases.

## Popularity

Until 30-Dec-2024, the github repo stars as shown below:

### Learning Curve

This section evaluates the learning curve associated with each library.

- **Refit**: Easiest to learn due to its simplicity, excellent documentation, and active community support.
- **RestSharp**: Easy to learn with comprehensive documentation and active community support. Slightly more complex due to broader feature set.
- **Flurl**: Relatively easy to learn with a fluent API that simplifies HTTP requests. Slightly steeper learning curve compared to Refit and RestSharp due to its unique approach.
- **Kiota**: Hardest to learn due to its complexity as a code generator and the additional steps required to understand and use the generated code. More suitable for advanced users.
