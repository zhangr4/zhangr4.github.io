When developing web API clients, especially for in C#. There are few popular options as far I can see: Kiota, Refit, Flurl, and RestSharp.

## Tech stack options

### Kiota

[Kiota](https://github.com/microsoft/kiota) is a code generator that creates API clients from OpenAPI descriptions. It supports multiple programming languages and aims to provide a consistent and type-safe way to interact with APIs.

Its primary purpose is to automatically generate API clients, which accelerates development but can also limit flexibility.

Pros:

- **Type Safety**: Generates strongly-typed clients, reducing runtime errors.
- **Multi-language Support**: Can generate clients for various languages.
- **Consistency**: Ensures a uniform approach to API consumption.

Cons:

- **Learning Curve**: Requires understanding of OpenAPI and the Kiota toolchain.
- **Setup**: Initial setup can be time-consuming.
- **Strict OpenAPI Definition**: The OpenAPI documentation must be precise and accurate.

### Refit

[Refit](https://github.com/reactiveui/refit) is a library for .NET that turns REST APIs into live interfaces. It uses attributes to define API endpoints and automatically generates the necessary code to call them.

Within the library, it uses source generator to generate interface implementation.

With [Refitter](https://github.com/christianhelle/refitter), C# REST API Client could be auto generated.

Pros:

- **Simplicity**: Easy to use with minimal boilerplate code.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with .NET projects.
- **Maintainability**: Changes to API endpoints are easy to manage.

Cons:

- **Limited to .NET**: Only available for .NET languages.
- **Performance**: May have overhead due to reflection.

### Flurl

[Flurl](https://github.com/tmenier/Flurl) is a modern, fluent, asynchronous, testable, and portable URL builder and HTTP client library for .NET. It simplifies making HTTP calls and handling URLs in a clean and readable way.

Pros:

- **Ease of Use**: Provides a fluent interface for building URLs and making HTTP requests.
- **Asynchronous**: Fully supports async/await for non-blocking operations.
- **Testable**: Designed with testability in mind, making it easy to mock HTTP calls.
- **Portable**: Works across different .NET platforms, including .NET Core and .NET Framework.

Cons:

- **Learning Curve**: May require some time to get familiar with its fluent syntax.
- **Dependency**: Adds an additional dependency to your project.

### RestSharp

[RestSharp](https://github.com/restsharp/RestSharp) is a popular library for building API clients in .NET. It provides a simple and flexible way to interact with RESTful services.

Pros:

- **Feature-Rich**: Supports a wide range of features like authentication, serialization, and more.
- **Community Support**: Large user base and active community.
- **Flexibility**: Can be used for simple and complex scenarios.

Cons:

- **Complexity**: Can be overkill for simple APIs.
- **Performance**: May have performance overhead in some cases.

## Popularity

- Github repository stars:

  The repository 'Microsoft/kiota' has 3081 stars.
  The repository 'reactiveui/refit' has 8723 stars.
  The repository 'tmenier/Flurl' has 4246 stars.
  The repository 'restsharp/RestSharp' has 9651 stars.

## Maintainability

Code consistency

Are the code and generated API client structured uniformly across different API definitions?

Documentation and Community Support

Official Documentation: How well-documented is the library? Does it explain setup, usage, advanced scenarios, and troubleshooting?
Community and Ecosystem: Are there active discussions, a sizable user base, or regular updates? Check GitHub issues, Stack Overflow, or forums.
Examples: Are there sufficient examples for both common and edge cases?

Maintenance Effort

Updates and Releases: How frequently does the library receive updates? Are there recent commits or releases?
Dependency Management: Does it rely on many external dependencies? If so, are these dependencies stable and well-maintained?
Backward Compatibility: Does the library ensure backward compatibility with prior versions?

Ease of Integration

Framework Compatibility: Does it integrate smoothly with your project’s framework (e.g., .NET Framework, .NET Core, or .NET 6/7)?
Customization: Can you easily extend or customize the generated client for specific requirements?
Integration Complexity: Does it provide simple mechanisms for features like retry policies, logging, and authentication?

Testing and Debugging

Testability: Does it support or simplify the testing of API calls (e.g., mocking HTTP responses)?
Debugging Tools: Are error messages and stack traces clear and helpful during development?

Licensing and Compliance

License Type: Is the library’s license compatible with your project’s licensing and distribution model (e.g., GPL, MIT)?
Corporate Policy Compliance: Does it align with your organization's software policies?

Ease of Adoption: How much time does it take for new developers to learn and use the library effectively?

open api support?

## Performance

I created a simple benchmarking to compare these different stacks, refer to ][ApiClientComparison](...)

## Shared feature

Despite their differences, Kiota, Refit, RestSharp, and Flurl share several common features that make them popular choices for developing web API clients:

- **HTTP Client Abstraction**: All these libraries provide an abstraction over the raw HTTP client, simplifying the process of making HTTP requests.
- **Asynchronous Support**: They support asynchronous operations, allowing for non-blocking HTTP calls.
- **Serialization/Deserialization**: Built-in support for serializing request bodies and deserializing response bodies, often using popular libraries like JSON.NET.
- **Error Handling**: Mechanisms to handle HTTP errors and exceptions gracefully.
- **Configuration**: Options to configure headers, query parameters, and other request settings.
- **Authentication**: Support for various authentication methods, such as OAuth, API keys, and basic authentication.
- **Extensibility**: Ability to extend and customize the behavior of the HTTP client through middleware, handlers, or plugins.
- **Dependency Injection**: Integration with dependency injection frameworks to manage the lifecycle of HTTP clients and related services.

Target use scenarios:

- with/without dependency injection

- open api specification provided or not

- use heavily or rare usage

- client sdk developer or api consumer
